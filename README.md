# fsvm

This is a disassembler and symbolic executor for the [fsvm challenge](https://github.com/ECSC2024/openECSC-2024/tree/main/round-1/rev01) from openECSC 2024.

Read the accompanying [blog post.](https://blog.deobfuscate.io)

## Usage

To run both the disassembler and symbolic executor run

```
python3 src/main.py

This will create `disassembly.txt` and `pseudocode.c` files in the `output` directory.
